## Course Description

This course focuses on the fundamentals of developing software. We will learn how to develop software from start to finish through the framework of the software development lifecycle. This course is team project-based and much of the learning will be done through developing software as a team. We will work on an existing codebase (legacy code).

**Registrar Description**: Covers the foundations of software engineering, including software development life cycle models (e.g., waterfall, spiral, agile); requirements analysis; user-centered design; software design principles and patterns; testing (functional testing, structural testing, testing strategies); code refactoring and debugging; software architecture and design; and integration and deployment. Includes a course project where some of the software engineering methods (from requirements analysis to testing) are applied in a team-based setting. Requires admission to MS program or completion of all transition courses.


## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will:

* Learn about the Software Development Lifecycle.
* Learn about effective design patterns and antipatterns.
* Gain experience building larger software.
* Gain experience writing tests.
* Learn a few specific tools (e.g. git) that will be relevant to your professional career.

## Resources

All resources can be accessed for free using your academic email. Northeastern Libraries provides free access to [O'Reilly Online](https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/).

All required and recommended textbooks can be acccessed using [this playlist](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/fe125c06-2637-4b38-8e08-fa30895b46f5). Or you can just search for the title on O'Reilly Online.

Most readings will focus on the following books: The Pragmatic Progammer, Code Complete, and Working Effectively with Legacy Code.

## Prerequisites

Graduate level CS 5004 Minimum Grade of C

## Academic Integrity and Non-Discrimination

Students and instructors are to follow the Northeastern policies on these important issues.

Northeastern Non-Discrimination Policy - This classroom is a safe space for the instructor and students to talk about ideas, share viewpoints, and learn.

Northeastern Academic Integrity Policy - You only cheat yourself if you are not honest. Most often cheating occurs when an individual falls behind or perhaps has other circumstances occurring in their life. Please consult the instructor before ever considering cheating.
If you are caught cheating I have to report the violation. My official policy is you receive a 0 in the course. Always remember, if you use any external sources, you must cite them.

Student Code of Conduct: Students and instructors will follow the following guide for how we conduct ourselves. This is to create a respectful environment where everyone can learn.

## Make-Up Policy

Occasionally, other life events and circumstances occur that were not planned. If this is the case, please e-mail me privately.

E-mailing me asking for extensions just because is unfortunately not fair to your classmates. The 10% penalty for each day late will be enforced. 

## Accessibility 

Part of what makes Northeastern University unique, is our diverse cohort of students, faculty, and staff. In order to support this, Northeastern is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the University experience.

If you have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact the Student Accessibility Services office at DRC@northeastern.edu or (617) 373-2675 to make an appointment with the Disability Resource Center representatives in 20 Dodge Hall to determine appropriate accommodations.

We Care is another university resource for helping tackle challenges you may be facing. Asking for help is okay!

## Lateness and Attendance Policy

Students who do well in this course tend to show up to the course consistently, participate, and engage with their peers. Come to class, come on time, and build good habits!

## Wellness

Northeastern Univerity provides resources for student healthcare and general wellness. Please visit Northeastern Health and Counseling Services for your needs. While university can be difficult at times, please do take care of yourself. It is okay to seek help and take a break. Please communicate with your instructor, advisor, and officials at the university if you just need a mental break.

## Assessment/Course Policies

Please find below the grading distribution that will be used for this course. You will find the grade you earn in this course on Canvas.

Participation: (10%) 

Labs: (15%) (Each equally weighted) 

Assignments: (15%) (Each equally weighted)

Final Project: (60%)

The grade system follows the University Grading System.

|                 |                                                                                               
|-----------------|
| A  = 95 – 100   |
| A- = 91 – 94.99 |
| B+ = 87 – 90.99 |
| B  = 83 – 86.99 |
| B- = 80 – 82.99 |
| C+ = 77 – 79.99 |
| C  = 73 – 76.99 |
| C- = 70 – 72.99 |
| D+ = 67 – 69.99 |
| D  = 63 – 66.99 |
| D- = 60 – 62.99 |
| F  =  0 – 59.99 |

In the event of a sick/snow day (i.e. we miss a lab or in-class activity) the weight of each assignment increases (There may also be shuffling of course material if we are interrupted).

The expectation is that the assignments are fair but difficult, so you should start early!
Late Submissions of Assignments receive 10% off per day submitted late (up to 3 days max, then 0% received)

Unfortunately, with large classes I cannot make individual exceptions (i.e. "special deals") fairly to your classmates who are likely making other personal sacrifices to complete work on time.

Come speak to me about your wellness if something is otherwise impeding your progress so we can provide you available resources to succeed.

Assignments containing programs that do not run (i.e. do not do anything) receive no credit.

There are no "re-grades" or points awarded one week after your grade is posted. "re-grades" may result in a higher, equal, or lower score.
There are no "re-grades" after the semester is over.

Do not ask multiple members of the course staff for "re-grades"

If you are currently waitlisted, you must submit your homework on time. That is the gamble! If you do not have Canvas access, you will submit by e-mail or other course mechanism (e.g. github).

There are no extra credit assignments just for you. I reserve the right to add points to assignments that do go above and beyond however. I reserve the right to give an extra credit assignment to the entire class, though this is highly unlikely.

I reserve the right to modify the grading scale in your favor if you show exemplary proficiency in any of the catagories. I will never modify the scale to lower a students grade.

Course work completed after the date cannot be graded, as solutions will have been discussed (this includes if taking this course for an Incomplete).

Lab time is meant for helping students with the lab, not completing homework. I have to prioritize lab first, then can answer homework questions.

No Facebook, no cell phones. Not only does it distract you, it distracts others!
