## Course Description

Covers the foundations of software engineering, including software development life cycle models (e.g., waterfall, spiral, agile); requirements analysis; user-centered design; software design principles and patterns; testing (functional testing, structural testing, testing strategies); code refactoring and debugging; software architecture and design; and integration and deployment. Includes a course project where some of the software engineering methods (from requirements analysis to testing) are applied in a team-based setting. 

This course focuses on the fundamentals of developing software. We will learn how to develop software from start to finish through the framework of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Critically evaluate software development methodologies**  
   - Analyze and compare software lifecycle models (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, Spiral) in terms of their applicability to different project contexts and constraints.

2. **Conduct comprehensive requirements engineering**  
   - Apply advanced techniques for eliciting, specifying, and validating software requirements, with attention to stakeholder needs and system constraints.

3. **Design robust software architectures**  
   - Utilize architectural patterns and design principles to create scalable, maintainable, and modular software systems.

4. **Implement software using industry-standard practices**  
   - Apply principles of version control, continuous integration, and test-driven development in the implementation of software solutions.

5. **Apply rigorous testing strategies**  
   - Design and execute functional, structural, and automated tests to ensure software correctness, reliability, and performance.

6. **Refactor and debug complex systems**  
   - Use systematic approaches to improve code quality and resolve defects in medium-to-large codebases.

7. **Collaborate effectively in team-based projects**  
   - Demonstrate proficiency in agile project management, peer code reviews, and collaborative development using tools like GitHub and issue trackers.

8. **Communicate technical decisions and trade-offs**  
   - Present design choices, testing strategies, and project outcomes clearly and professionally in both written and oral formats. Examples include Design Documents, sequence diagrams, entity relationship diagrams

9. **Reflect on ethical and professional responsibilities**  
   - Evaluate the societal impact of software systems and adhere to ethical standards in software engineering practice.

10. **Integrate theory with practice through a capstone project**  
    - Apply the full spectrum of software engineering techniques—from requirements to deployment—in a semester-long team project simulating real-world development.

## Prerequisites

Graduate level CS 5004 and CS 5010

## Academic Integrity and Non-Discrimination

Students and instructors are to follow the Northeastern policies on these important issues.

Northeastern Non-Discrimination Policy - This classroom is a safe space for the instructor and students to talk about ideas, share viewpoints, and learn.

Northeastern Academic Integrity Policy - You only cheat yourself if you are not honest. Most often cheating occurs when an individual falls behind or perhaps has other circumstances occurring in their life. Please consult the instructor before ever considering cheating.
If you are caught cheating I have to report the violation. My official policy is you receive a 0 in the course. Always remember, if you use any external sources, you must cite them.

Student Code of Conduct: Students and instructors will follow the following guide for how we conduct ourselves. This is to create a respectful environment where everyone can learn.

## Artificial Intelligence

In this course, you will learn critical knowledge and skills of software engineering. 
While it may be possible to use commercial tools such as
ChatGPT and Claude to complete assignments, doing so will cheat yourself of the needed
learning for your future career. Given the prevalence of these tools and the temptation to
use them, we will structure teaching, assignments, and assessments to appropriately use
AI at this stage of your education.

Excelling at computer and data sciences fundamentally requires learning by doing. You will 
be taught the fundamentals of computer sciences and how to use AI tools
productively for computer science tasks.
AI tools are increasingly used for software development and will likely be part of your co-op experiences. 

My commitment to you is that I will explicitly communicate when it is acceptable, and even advisable, to use
AI as part of this course. I will also explicitly communicate when you should not use AI to
complete assignments. The use of AI in Khoury classes will evolve as you move from
learning the fundamentals to specifying, designing, and creating complex software
systems. My commitment is to proactively integrate the use of AI tools as your learning
progresses so that, upon co-op and graduation, you are performing at the top of your field.

## Make-Up Policy

Occasionally, other life events and circumstances occur that were not planned. If this is the case, please e-mail me privately.

E-mailing me asking for extensions just because is unfortunately not fair to your classmates. The 10% penalty for each day late will be enforced. 

## Accessibility 

Part of what makes Northeastern University unique, is our diverse cohort of students, faculty, and staff. In order to support this, Northeastern is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the University experience.

If you have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact the Student Accessibility Services office at DRC@northeastern.edu or (617) 373-2675 to make an appointment with the Disability Resource Center representatives in 20 Dodge Hall to determine appropriate accommodations.

We Care is another university resource for helping tackle challenges you may be facing. Asking for help is okay!

## Lateness and Attendance Policy

Students who do well in this course tend to show up to the course consistently, participate, and engage with their peers. Come to class, come on time, and build good habits!

## Wellness

Northeastern Univerity provides resources for student healthcare and general wellness. Please visit Northeastern Health and Counseling Services for your needs. While university can be difficult at times, please do take care of yourself. It is okay to seek help and take a break. Please communicate with your instructor, advisor, and officials at the university if you just need a mental break.

## Assessment/Course Policies

Please find below the grading distribution that will be used for this course. You will find the grade you earn in this course on Canvas.

* Participation: (5%)

* Homework, Quizes, Labs: (20%) 

* Mid-term Exam: (25%)

* Final Project: (50%)


The grade system follows the University Grading System.

|                 |                                                                                               
|-----------------|
| A  = 95 – 100   |
| A- = 91 – 94.99 |
| B+ = 87 – 90.99 |
| B  = 83 – 86.99 |
| B- = 80 – 82.99 |
| C+ = 77 – 79.99 |
| C  = 73 – 76.99 |
| C- = 70 – 72.99 |
| D+ = 67 – 69.99 |
| D  = 63 – 66.99 |
| D- = 60 – 62.99 |
| F  =  0 – 59.99 |

In the event of a sick/snow day (i.e. we miss a lab or in-class activity) the weight of each assignment increases (There may also be shuffling of course material if we are interrupted).

The expectation is that the assignments are fair but difficult, so you should start early!
Late Submissions of Assignments receive 10% off per day submitted late (up to 3 days max, then 0% received)

Unfortunately, with large classes I cannot make individual exceptions (i.e. "special deals") fairly to your classmates who are likely making other personal sacrifices to complete work on time.

Come speak to me about your wellness if something is otherwise impeding your progress so we can provide you available resources to succeed.

Assignments containing programs that do not run (i.e. do not do anything) receive no credit.

There are no "re-grades" or points awarded one week after your grade is posted. "re-grades" may result in a higher, equal, or lower score.
There are no "re-grades" after the semester is over.

Do not ask multiple members of the course staff for "re-grades"

If you are currently waitlisted, you must submit your homework on time. That is the gamble! If you do not have Canvas access, you will submit by e-mail or other course mechanism (e.g. github).

There are no extra credit assignments just for you. I reserve the right to add points to assignments that do go above and beyond however. I reserve the right to give an extra credit assignment to the entire class, though this is highly unlikely.

I reserve the right to modify the grading scale in your favor if you show exemplary proficiency in any of the catagories. I will never modify the scale to lower a students grade.

Course work completed after the date cannot be graded, as solutions will have been discussed (this includes if taking this course for an Incomplete).

Lab time is meant for helping students with the lab, not completing homework. I have to prioritize lab first, then can answer homework questions.

No Facebook, no cell phones. Not only does it distract you, it distracts others!
